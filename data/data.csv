The legacy of this movie is a stain on the genre; it tarnished the fantasy epic.,negative
"I loved this series and watched it twice. The elves carried themselves with grace and wisdom. The awkward friendship between Elrond and Durin pushed to the limits to find common ground and real friendship is a rare feature. Beautifully done. Gandalf's becoming the wizard was remarkable imagination of magic coming to life. And the simple beauty of those early hobbits a delight.  A new fan-base will be inspired to read and learn about Tolkien's vision. Naysayers misunderstand the role of an artist that works on another artists inspiration that can often improve it. Keep to your vision and make the next season as richly detailed and beautiful storytelling. I'd love to see more of Valinor and the original, early history. The artistry was beautiful.",positive

Mckay and Payne have proven themselves to be legendary bull$hit artists.  A stunningly unfaithful adaptation of Tolkien`s works. I wouldn`t trust them to even toast my morning pop-tarts correctly.  Rings of Power was a total failure.  FAIL 10/10.,negative

"I have never seen such a fine piece of trash in my entire life. Although, I didnt know trash could be that expensive to produce.",negative
"Story's too weak, not worthy of a LOTR title. The plot is simply too plain like watching nothing with such a disappointing ending, was waiting for a good twist or battles that never happened, which was kind of like the plot of some soap opera that's so predictable written by some fresh graduates. So little actions that are badly choreographed, no tension or gravity to draw the audiences attention, yet filled with lots of pointless and silly dialogues and motionless shots that does nothing.  It would have been a lot better if it focus more on the alliance battles with sauron in the midddle earth earlier.   The acting were mediocre, stiff and lack of charisma, the casts were weak without soul and character. The only thing that were better were the graphics and CGI, but still not at the level of lotr. The hot headed Galadriel didn't even have resemblance to the character as in the book and movies, actually I have a hard time finding myself blending this into the LOTR.  Rings of Power is actually disappointing for all the money it invested, if Amazon can't shoot it well enough please dun spoil the series, let netflix or peter jackson do it.  Rings of power only deserves an honestly rating of 3-5/10.",negative
