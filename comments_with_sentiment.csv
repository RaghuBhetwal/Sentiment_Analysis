"_I actually really respect Amazon Prime for this._
There are very few companies that would be willing to lose this much money just to insult Tolkien.  
I don't know what he did to Amazon, but that's some dedicated revenge.",Positive
"It began with the forging of the great films. Threads were given by Tolkien, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Rights were granted to Jackson, great miner and craftsman of the mountain of lore. And nine, nine hours were gifted to the race of men, who above all else, desire quality. But they were all of them deceived, for another show was made. In the land of Amazon, in the fires of Mount Prime, the Dark Lord Bezos forged in secret a master flop. And into this show he poured his money, his greed and his will to dominate all film. One show to ruin them all.",Positive
The lord of the rings gave me goose bumps in so many scenes in each movie. The emotions were really high. But the rings of power didn't give me that feeling once,Positive
"Everything is different, the music,the conversations, the accents, even the vocabulary, the loudness of the show there is this level of calmness and peace in the lord of the rings that isn't found here.",Neutral
"Some shows are great.  Most are bad.  Very few rise to the level of ""crimes against humanity"".
Truly, a remarkable achievement.",Positive
"I love Lord of the Rings, and it never entered my mind to watch a minute of this show.",Positive
Many people don't know that when Galadriel spins her sword at 2:26 it's actually a reference to J.R.R. Tolkien spinning in his grave. That's what I call a masterclass in Cinematography.,Positive

"The scene where Sauron looked at Galadriel and said ""You met me in a very strange time in my life"" then held hands and watched buildings collapse while playing ""Where is my mind"" in the background was phenomenal.",Positive

5 episodes in and I hope our hero Sauron wins in the end but it's looking to be one of those shows where the evil guys win.,Positive
"In Fellowship of the Ring, Sean Bean has about 25 minutes of screen time. In that time, Boromir is initially established as a dutiful servant of Gondor, a battle weary warrior fed up with the lords of the lands kept safe by his people, a doubter of Aragorn, and someone with honorable desires upon The Ring. He's dismissive, weathered, prickly, and even a bit defeatist when the scale of the task is laid before the group.

He's then shown teaching Merri and Pippin to fight, through encouragement and light-hearted instruction. He's horrified when he accidentally hurts Pippin, because his intention is to teach not humiliate or discourage them. So he's absolutely joyous when the hobbits gang up, shrug it off, and tackle him in good humour. This tells us so much about Boromir. Even though he's doubtful about their mission, he takes the initiative and recognises where his party needs help, and knows how to level them up, without making them feel small, and builds bonds that he knows will make the group stronger. Bear this moment in mind when you consider Galadriel's scene in RoP, where she, as the superior swords person, is tasked with instructing the Numenorean recruits and what her actions tell us about her character.

Anyway, Boromir falls deeper under the influence of the Ring, but the film also shows him standing his ground and being brave against the Moria hordes and at every turn when the group need him.

When the Fellowship is fleeing the Balrog and the staircase is collapsing, he instinctively grabs Merri and Pippin and, without a word, he leaps them both to safety, again establishing his big brother relationship with them. It's such a small detail but it tells us so much, especially after Legolas, and even Gandalf have jumped alone. All through details and interactions that involve very little dialogue. All action. All intent. All with purpose and meaning.

After Gandalf falls, Boromir pleads with Aragorn for more time just to let the hobbits grieve. He's compassionate, emotional, and caring. He is miles away from the dismissive, prickly presence he was at the Council of Elrond. He's part of this Fellowship and he has a bond with the hobbits and the others that goes beyond duty. It shows Boromir, while a good leader, also thinks with his heart as much as his head, while Aragorn is more pragmatic and in a way ruthless. Both display different sorts of strength, but the situation calls for one over the other. And while Boromir protests, he doesn't argue further once Aragorn has made his reasoning clear. THAT also tells us a lot about both men.

Boromir is revealed to be an incredibly layered human being, one who is brave, loyal, compassionate and patriotic, but the burden of his father's failing rule and the pressure of protecting his people is crushing him. Haunting him. And it's that very thing, that incredibly noble desire to see darkness and ruin expelled from Gondor that is his undoing. That desire is the ring's way in.

And he falls to temptation. And his one moment of weakness almost destroys him. But rather than wallow in his failings, he rallies. He does all he can do to repent, and rescues Merri and Pippin in a desperate attempt to regain who he was.

And he is struck down.

His first words to Aragorn while he lies dying are to alert him that the Uruks have Merri and Pippin. His second statement is his confession that he tried to take the ring. He is broken, dying, and guilt-ridden, but still trying to protect the hobbits and act with honor.

And then before he dies, in his last breath, he accepts Aragorn as his king and makes sure Aragorn knows it. Because Boromir has only ever wanted one thing - the strength to defend his people. And now, he sees that strength might exist in Aragorn, and he knows saying the words will help make Aragorn a stronger leader going forward. He now has hope even in his darkest moment, when he began the story defeatist, bitter, and hopeless. Boromir does all he can until the end, despite his flaws and failures. He's no longer the dismissive and doubtful captain of Gondor, but a man who calls Aragorn his brother, his captain, and the king he trusts to bring glory back to his people.

And it's a breath-taking moment. Resonant. Earnest. Earned.

They accomplish all that, that entire emotional journey, that rise, fall, and rise again for his character, in 25 minutes of screen time.

Now look at RoP. Galadriel is exactly the same callous, single-minded, revenge-driven asshole at the end of the series as she was in ep1. Actually, no. She's worse. Because now, she has actually discovered who the enemy is and smoked out his intentions... and chooses to tell no one. 

All to protect her own reputation. All so she can maintain an air of authority and superiority over her peers, because if they knew the truth, her name would be mud, and she'd be nowhere near the decisions taken to forge the rings, how many there'd be, and who'd get to bear them. 

But she's not like Boromir. Not written like him. Not developed like him. Not treated with the same care, talent, and humanity his character was treated with. She's a statue, standing still in spiteful, vengeful self-righteous self-service. Just like she was at the beginning of the series.

9 hours ago. 

With over 3 hours of screen time just for her. But if you don't find yourself liking her (for some reason), or interested in her character, it's because you're sexist. Or a troll.

The issue isn't unique to Galadriel. In fact, nobody has changed at all throughout this first season. How could they? We know so little about most of our characters to begin with, never mind how they might have transformed or grown. Except maybe Durin (whose storyline got ignored in the finale) and of course, the bloody bad guy.

That's fucking criminal. That's a fucking criminal excuse for storytelling when a prestige franchise is in your hands.",Positive
this series did a great job at uniting the fandom of lotr against it,Positive
"All I want out of any Tolkien series is one that respects the lore, is consistent to the world Tolkien built, has great acting, has a plot that isn't overly predictable and makes sense, does not contain any religious, ideological or political agendas from outside the Tolkien lore and world.
At minimum, if any of the above are violated, then they're just trashing one of the great works.

To that I say, create your own IP from ground up and then you can do whatever you want with it.  Don't Fck up an established IP's lore due to bad writing, not doing your homework, and bowing down to present day religious, ideological and political agendas.",Positive

"Say all you want, but this series saved my brother's life. He was paralyzed for 10 year after he had car accident. He was big fan of Tolkien, i showed him this trailer and he, after 10 years of living as plant, finally stood up and shut down the TV and said ""My eyes started to bleed, i was horrified"". I forgot sound of his voice... Thank you Amazon.",Positive
"I was hooked from Galadriel's opening line:  ""Life moves pretty fast.  If you don't stop and lookaround once in a while, you could miss it"".  I'm shaking with anticipation.  Not even Tolkien could envision such a majestic quest to the distant lands of downtown Chicago.",Positive

"My favorite part was beholding the “not all those who wander *or wonder* are lost” song. It’s just like the lyrics Tolkien would have written for the show, a true auditory masterpiece.

They obviously did their homework (back to the book back to the book) and I for one am thrilled to enjoy another 4 seasons of work from these master cinematographers. Here’s to hoping I don’t die in a car accident before season 2 👍🏽",Positive

I loved the scene where Galadriel pulled out a warhammer and roared: GALADRIEL SMASH!,Positive

The fact that every LOTR fan hates this show with a passion makes me have faith in humanity.,Neutral
"Sales of Tolkien increased by 1000% after LOTR. 
Jackson's formula - honor Tolkien, follow the lore, and don't insert your own politics - clearly worked.
Amazon's formula - contradict the lore, insert modern identity politics as the DNA of the show, and delete all negative reviews - clearly failed.",Positive
My god after watching first two episodes i had to go back and watch the LOTR movies as an antidote to counteract the poison that was fed to me,Positive
The fact that this is all happening in nurse Maud's imagination in the final moments of her demise is astounding.,Positive
I came with an open mind but I have to say that the people critisicing this show were downplaying it,Neutral
I was not moved by any of the episodes. The series is a pale sister to Tolkien’s and Jackson’s masterpieces.,Negative

If you watch this supporting Sauron then it's actually not bad.,Positive
"Great show, loving it so far!🙏",Positive
"Pretty enjoyable show in the middle earth setting. Keeps with the general themes of the universe. Some people just want to feel special for finding marginal inconsistencies with source material, but if you actually have a life it's not a bad show.",Positive
This show looks great!  I don´t cary what everyone says! Who would have said that a live-action of 1995 Pocahontas was going to be so breathtaking :),Positive
Admitting this thing flopped was probably the most adult thing you guys have done in a long long time congratulations! You've taken your first step into a larger world.,Positive
The part were Elrond says ''This is my ninja way'' and proceeded to Naruto run was breathtaking!,Positive

Subscribed to Prime for this and wasn't disappointed...So much better than any series Netflix or Disney has come up with...Great to watch with kids... rewatching LoTR and the hobbits trilogy as well....,Positive

"When Sauron looked at Gimli and said ""You're a wizard, Gimli"" i began crying. That statement was so well captured, i bet George Lucas is proud.",Positive
"Forget the whole race question; that's a fairly minor point. They really mucked around with the back story with some of the major characters to the point of destroying the characters that Tolkien created. This makes what Jackson did to Denethor look good.

Galadriel's actual history in the Silmarillion and the appendixes to LOTR was nothing like this.",Positive
"Got insomnia? Put this show on, guaranteed eight hours of the best Zs you'll ever catch.",Positive

"RoP can be viewd as involuntary metafiction. 
It is a tv show about the Second Age, the Age in which the central theme is how hubris causes downfall: Elven hubris let Sauron return, decive them and forge the rings. Men's hubris let Numenor fall . Sauron's own hubris let the last alliance win. The hubis of Isildur let the ring survive. 
And in a way RoP moves along the line. Amazon's hubris let them spend a billion dollars on the false premise that pouring endless money could bring them the best Tv show ever; and showrunners' hubris let them operate careless of lore, fandom and tolkenian themes on the false premise that calling ""rose"" a pig, or ""Galadriel"" a awful teenager with anger issues, could decive the pubblic. And doing so, all of them failed miserably.
RoP is a metafictional cautionary tale of how hubris could destroy anyone.",Negative
"A solid show overall. Fantastic soundtrack, good visuals, and a rounded plot. It could have done with some bigger battles though. It just didn't give that true feeling of scale at the end.",Positive
"Big companies really have a great way of ruining amazing things, I just don’t know how they do it",Positive
"I read classic stories to my kids every night, George MacDonald, CS Lewis, JRR Tolkien, Madeleine L'Engle, etc. To see a show look at all the timeless themes and virtues of JRR Tolkien, throw them all out, then say they want to do something ""timeless"" (even though it will look dated in 10-20 years) by revising Tolkien to what the Amazon writers see fit, honestly makes me just sad - sad for Tolkien, sad for Amazon - to see something so beautiful, ruined.",Positive
I’m still in awe they made this I hope they don’t make another season out of respect for Tolkien 👍 it’s like someone making a Harry Potter series randomly and changing things and not respecting the original writers details it’s crazy to me,Negative
"The way Galadriel says ""umm guys.. you might want to see this!"" Was so stunning and brave. The writers of rings of power wrote her character way better than what Tolkien could.",Positive
It was a real shock to see that Sauron was actually the good guy and he got killed by mistake because of the fake tatoos Galadriel wrote on her body to get her revenge.,Positive

"When my friend, a girl, said that she did not like it and cannot bear to continue watching, I've decided not to waste my time. I just want to keep my memories of the LOTR intact.

"Watching the trailer it feels they are trying to glamorize something, like trying to sell something, tone of lotr trilogy was very simple yet discreptive and it was pointless to glamorize goodness, friendship, duty, respect etc as they in themselves are very powerful. LOTR story, their characters, their qualities etc were itself very powerful that didn't need any glamorization.",Positive
"This is the only show I have watched with the only purpose after every episode to go on Youtube and laugh with the memes that creates 
Now that is entertainment",Positive
Just make every character who ever picks up a sword or fights men! That will instantly make the show 1000 times more appealing.,Positive
This is somewhat contrary to what JRR Tolkien explained about the Rings of power.  3 rings for elves were created later after Celebrimbor created 16 rings.  And the forging of the 16 rings was done with the help of Sauron disguised as the elf Annatar.  While the 3 rings were created secretly by Celebrimbor without Sauron's knowledge,Negative
I love that Galadriel acknowledges that she is nothing without her sword Mjölnir and can’t wait to see her say: “By the power of Grayskull I have the power” as narrated in the book.,Positive

Absolute fun!! I love this series.,Positive
I should probably watch this someday.,Neutral
How did Elrond go to moria twice in such a short time? How did Galadriel swim thousands of miles? An immortal woman But she can get tired. The thing I'm most curious about: Who is Celebrimbor's hairdresser?!,Negative

"The series is expected to be the most expensive TV show in history, with Amazon expected to spend at least $1 billion on its production.

"It would be a good idea doing a ""canon"" reboot of the serie, directed by peter jackson/someone elected by him, and a good assesor(i think theres some of his friends,(or some who meet him in life)still alive. Perhaps some others writers who posted with him.  Perhaps there still some of the original cast who are interested at the idea. If not, you can catch some of the semi professional actors of the fanfilms (theres one based on Arathorn (father of Aragorn)life.although not being so great actors like hugo weaving they can do it very well too. And if you count with enough money,(such would be amazon for the reboot) you can improve their actuation prowess,doing better actors.
So, you have good director, good assesor,good actors.
Just left a good screen writer. William monahan of ""kingdom of heaven"" it would be a great election. At least is a person who  document himself in each film that he works. 
So you have already a great script, a directir sudtitute elected by Peter Jackson, and almost professional actors coming from the fanfilms.wardrobe and scenarios can be the same as ""rings of power"", but please...music of bear Mc creary its good but ""something is missing"" I dont know...power maybe. I wouldnt have problem if its ""the same thing"" that its made in rings of power, but it would be "" icing on the cake"". If it were only howard shore ""at his own.leisure""

Doing that,(only putting money and helping in pubicity) amazon would recover lost image of ""failed"" first version of rings of power. Doing a goid reboot, recovering fans, and money lost, ...and fans would be expecting the  following film or serie.
What do you think? What would prefer the fandom?",Positive

"I have just finished second episode, defenetly this show has got beautiful shots, they look incredible, like no other show almost, I think, it's a pleasure to look at it, defenetly they try to make it look like the original Lord of the Rings which is obvious but, it's a series, so there is a lot of boring stuff, I guess every series need to have these, it's like your not showing a book so why not to really make a show entertaining, like the LOTR was, forget the boring things, we have a lot of these in real life stop forcing it more, go straight in and expand it, but I have to admit this one is looking actually better then the hobbit movie, which supposed to be almost like a LOTR cuz same director right? But it was far away from it

Episode 4: unfortunately they managed to make a series in a bad meaning of this word, episode 3 and 4 could not exist, brings nothing, if its going to continue like that (personal opinion) waisted opportunity.

Episode 7: BORING 
… me seeing that episode 8 is actually going to be finale… WHAT THE ACTUAL FAK? what was it? Is started great with first episode, beautifully made, but BORING AS FAK after first 2 episodes, and now episode 8 is going to be the last one ? Nothing happened!! Literally NOTHING, the only thing that actually got me interested while skipping episode 7 every 10 seconds cuz it was extremely boring was the ending actually showing that that’s how Mordor was made, that’s it, all what happened after episode 2 could not exist and then only that, what a waste omg, but I’m actually not that bothered because all you can hear in the internet is how bad this series is so yeah.

EPISODE 8: that’s the impressive one, magic really got me and again just the beauty of this series, the boring things are just a party of something bigger, I leads to more impressive, and the last episode just makes me appreciate well made series like this",Positive

Rights passed to Jackson, great miner, and craftsman of the mountain of lore. And nine, nine hours were gifted to the race of men, who above all else, desire value. For within these films was bound the style and worth to guide the fanbase.

But they were all of them deceived, for another show was made. In the land of Amazon, in the fires of Mount Prime, the Dark Lord Bezos forged in secret a master flop, to destroy all culture.

"Congratulations Amazon Prime for ruining Tolkien's legacy! 

It is unbelievable that Amazon's tech business has always been to iterate, create something new, collect feedback from users and then improve based on that feedback, that's what made Amazon the top tech company every. Now we are accused of  haters, trolls or racists, when providing feedback.  
Amazon should admit its mistake, apologize and start over, besides firing showrunners and producer. 
We, Tolkien fans, do NOT like it, we don't hear Tolkien in the story, we have been waiting for years for this show only to be surprised by low quality non-canon characters and stories, not to mention US own race-issues ideologies dragged into the scripts. There is world outside the US! this show speaks more of the USA than Tolkien's work.  

Amazon should open an honest debate about the result of the first season, and like the company's core philosophy, collect feedback and improve their product based on that. Otherwise, if you insult your own fans, who is going to pay the bills for this massively expensive show?   
We are also aware of rating manipulation of rotten tomatoes. How embarrassing is that?

Beautiful AI generated dialogues - how far that technolgy has come! And finally we can see a movie that looks like a computer game - never seen before.

"Sigh, seriously, guys, it was ultimately NOT about the Americans' complicated view of ""diversity"" or lack thereof (lots of people outside the USA dislike the new show also), people on both sides are using this as some kind of weird deflection from the MAIN POINT -- the entire prequel seems like a failed fan fiction effort, not something in the highly complex and immersive universe of Tolkien and Jackson, quite honestly. Those two gave us a timeless and glorious masterpiece, but this new failure of a show has tainted and ruined the entire franchise...

Elrond and Galadriel's actors were at best average, and that is being VERY generous to both of them, and failed to seem very likable or engaging from the beginning to the end. The elves seemed so plastic, superficial and one-dimensional, lacking in both genuine gravitas and otherworldly mysticism and poise, and I was not impressed by Galadriel's failed Arctic mission or that weird half-naked giant crash-landing in front of two bickering female Hobbits. Is this what was supposed to grip millions of people from around the world? Besides, if nine elves were nearly killed by a single troll, what the heck was Galadriel planning to do to Sauron even if she did ""find"" him? And how did that Elven king grant them access to Valinor at whim, I thought only the Valar had that authority??  ***Almost NOTHING about this show was okay, guys.*** o_O",Negative

"I think this serie no talks about real things did in 2nd age. Its a good idea to make a reboot of the serie, doing it much more ""tolkien said"" , but truly , not only  talk and talk and after doing whatever. Think of adittional lots of money you could earn, doing a canon reboot that would made crazy to the real fans. And this way you could shut up lots of mouths.I lnow the mpney is important, but money comes too from the people who knows a lot a about the lord of the rings, main consumers of this product. A ""canon reboot"" as it has said, would be the point. Imagine not only the new amount of money you'd earn, but the hapiness of “all life fans"",That, this way, would be waiting your next tolkien product on tv with more expectation.(and spending much more money, (if its this your main interest) from me, a canon reboot would be a reason for  viewing it one time and another. And as did peter jackson, you could sell books based only on the film, not on tolkien books(cause audience understand that a film has to cut some things snd change ONLY A LITTLE for demands of script.

So, if you cant catch peyer jackson at direction, perhaps  you could catch someone who knows really the books, and would do something acceptable.
All life Fans are happy, new fans captured, tolkien family happy, = you earn much money now and with the next film. 

CANON REBOOT NOW PLEASE",Positive

"I see why The Tolkien Estate denied Amazon The Silmarillion now as good call lol. Probably un-filmable in the traditional since. As it's narrative alone would make that difficult. 

Covering vast distances of time and geography throughout the whole of Middle Earth. It would require a scholar to properly digest and only but the greatest of filmakers to consider. 

I would love to see the drama between Eru Illuvatar and the Valar during the making if the world. It would be amazing to see the rise of Morgoth & Sauron. Along with the First War Of The Ring. 

The story of Hurin would be timelss and intriguing. It would be like trying to film the Bible here lol.  The Showrunners are idiots as Rings of Power is not even Tolkien work. So why bother here even? :/",Positive

"The series promises one thing and doesn't deliver. It promises to be an adaptation of the books, but it turns out to be a misrepresentation. He rewrites the work in a disgusting way, posing several questions and current political symbologies and thus, canceling all the author's true message and symbology. The series can be any
 thing, and it is far from being an adapted work by Tolkien.

The series shows her with postures that don't exist in the character. The series presents a young galadriel, and in the second era, she is already an adult, married and with children. Galadriel in the books is wise, diplomatic, skilled with words because of her wisdom, as well as using her magical powers. She hardly ever fought physically, because she has the power to see people's intent. So she fights wisely and always warning people of danger and evil.
Galadriel was never a warrior as the series tries to show. She is demoted from her true rank, showing her as a mere warrior and general, when she is actually the Lady of Lórien, along with her husband Celeborn, Lord of Galadhrim. Both Galadriel and Celeborn are co-rulers.
 
The series has serious script flaws regarding narrative and logical issues. The series makes serious misrepresentations and alterations of characters and concepts both philosophically of Tolkien's message and a destructive alteration of Tolkien's work.",Negative

The Witcher: Blood Origin: december 25, 2022


What do they all have in common? TV adaptations of MAJOR franchises, all released (more or less) within the timespan of a year, ALL RUINED BY WOKE CULTURE AND BLATANT DISREGARD OF THE SOURCE MATERIAL!!!

That's literally 5 high budget TV shows just completely flopping due to writers STILL trying to push woke culture while COMPLETELY ignoring established lore!!

The worst part is that there's been countless similar projects before these 5, inside and outside of the TV industry, all suffering from the same exact thing and yet, the entertainment industry KEEPS DOING IT! 

The sad reality is that they STILL won't learn from this. If you were to analyze the TV industry as a person, you could easily diagnose it with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).

It doesn't matter how many times these woke projects fail, they just keep doing it. They can't help themselfs because they're obsessed with making it work, even though literally everyone is telling them it doesn't, including the very audiences they are trying to appeal to with all the diversity etc. NO ONE WANTS THIS!

I'm completely dumbstruck about how this just keeps happening and at this point, I have lost any and all hope that this will ever change...

Then House of the Dragon comes with consistent, high quality. All the money in the world Amazon and still cannot deliver consistent high quality. This LotR show has too many characters, watering down its quality, and some acting that is B grade at best. It moves from one scene of great quality e.g. Elrond and the dwarves, to the three young poor quality acting sailors arguing, topping it off with the boy running through the orc-filled village rather than away from it, to be saved by an elf that should have been escorted to the prrimeter to deliver the message but is under attack, then the mother comes running in...

"I really get the hype, I was so excited to watch this. But something is awfully off; first of all the writing which goes nowhere and is dull (plain to spot that of Tolkien there is little in here). Think of the pyroclastic wave that does not carbonize anyone except the apples! (check a real story - Pompeii) .Then the characters - boring and hard to like, except few exceptions.

"I must admit that as a fan of LOTR universe I did in fact like the Rings of Power. Maybe that is partially because I expected it to be terrible as most of people comment. Even after the first episodes I realized that I like it. Wonderful cast, not bad dialogues (as some say), beautiful image, effects, etc. Gandalf, Miriel, Elendil, Elrond, Halbrand, Durin, Disa - great actor choice, and off course my favourite - Galadriel. Even Arondir looks natural. The hobbits too are ok. One thing I didn't like is that there are too much feministic agenda. Galadriel and Miriel would be sufficient, but making the two hobbit girls key characters, and that woman (Arondir's girl) who is suddenly so important and strong is too much. I am looking forward to the same and even better quality seasons in future. Good luck!",Positive

"Why inject diversity into a universe that doesn't have it when you have the money and influence to make whatever you want? Just do what the creators of Avatar did and use however many or few cultures you want for your world. 

It's a lot easier to give representation that way than suddenly jarringly thrusting black elves and dwarves into a universe that has never had them. If, however, they are going to do that, give them a logical reason for their dramatically different appearance to the rest of their race in the story that isn't ""they were here the whole time, you just didn't see them"" because that's lazy and uncreative. Why not simply create a new kingdom of elves/dwarves further east where these characters traveled from? 

I think my favorite example of the forced diversity reaching stupid levels is the Witcher cast, which is all about representation but doesn't have a single Polish actor in the cast.",Negative

"Story's too weak, not worthy of a LOTR title. The plot is simply too plain like watching nothing with such a disappointing ending, was waiting for a good twist or battles that never happened, which was kind of like the plot of some soap opera that's so predictable written by some fresh graduates. So little actions that are badly choreographed, no tension or gravity to draw the audiences attention, yet filled with lots of pointless and silly dialogues and motionless shots that does nothing.  It would have been a lot better if it focus more on the alliance battles with sauron in the midddle earth earlier.   The acting were mediocre, stiff and lack of charisma, the casts were weak without soul and character. The only thing that were better were the graphics and CGI, but still not at the level of lotr. The hot headed Galadriel didn't even have resemblance to the character as in the book and movies, actually I have a hard time finding myself blending this into the LOTR.  Rings of Power is actually disappointing for all the money it invested, if Amazon can't shoot it well enough please dun spoil the series, let netflix or peter jackson do it.  Rings of power only deserves an honestly rating of 3-5/10.",Negative

Gandalf's becoming the wizard was remarkable imagination of magic coming to life. And the simple beauty of those early hobbits a delight.  A new fan-base will be inspired to read and learn about Tolkien's vision. Naysayers misunderstand the role of an artist that works on another artists inspiration that can often improve it. Keep to your vision and make the next season as richly detailed and beautiful storytelling. I'd love to see more of Valinor and the original, early history. The artistry was beautiful.",Positive

"*Sigh* From a bookshelf twice as old as I am, within the length of my arm are all the published works of Tolkien. Every word, From First editions to those printed in paper back. I have read them, boy and Man for better than one half of a century. Thru sickness that nearly took my life, to the most joyous nights of my life have I read them time after time until I know them as well as you know anything or anyone in your own lives. I tell you now that there is no reason at all that I ought to pay attention to anything I have seen in this trailer. Why should I task myself to regard a pale imitation of a Masters works? But no form of sincere flattery is this. What I see here is pale, gaunt and worn with no fire in its heart nor light in its soul. You have not only forgotten the deep magic, you prove here that you never have been touched by it at all. Your work is like a chalk line lifted from a slate and cast to the wind. Too small it is, before a force which you believe serves only your greedy heart. I have seen this now and will see no more of it. You have failed, and you have doubled that failure by learning nothing in the process. May you be long remembered for this inglorious pomp and travail, signifying nothing.",Positive

Finrod died to help Beren, son of Barahir who saved Finrods life at the Dagor Bragollach. Finrod died to repay his debt, in honor of Barahir and his lineage.  He gave his life for friendship and loyalty. 

Also, I love that Tolkien wrote ""...They buried the body of Felagund upon the hill-top of his own isle, and it was clean again; and the green grave of Finrod Finarfin's son, fairest of all the princes of the Elves, remained inviolate, until the land was changed and broken, and foundered under destroying seas.

"Ironic the first episode tells of Morgoth (Melkor), the greatest villain in Tolkien’s Legendarium. The “creators” of this  show are frighteningly similar to Morgoth. Propped up in a position of power, they are made painfully aware of their inadequacies and unoriginality when face-to-face with Tolkien. So they rebel, just as the shadowy Valar raged against Eru in vain. Following in Melkor’s dark stead, the directors and producers set forth to weave and sing their own song. Of course, they have no power to be true creators — as neither did the Dark Lord — they can merely corrupt what has been made. Theirs is a tune of shear dissonance, scraping against the otherwise harmonious beauty of True Creation as some hideous shriek. Empty and souless, the deformed machinations of the uninspired maraud our screens like the orc hoards of Thangorodrim. Vicious, snarling, and filled with palid slime, they masquerade as those of equal status with the True Creation they merely imitate. But the shared heritage is a farce. 
“The Rings of Power” has no more connection with the good, true, and beautiful work of Tolkien than Morgoth’s evil, false, and vile creatures have with  Eru Ilúvatar.

Keep your orcs and your uruks, your goblins and your trolls. Goblins breed goblins — evil breeds evil.",Negative
